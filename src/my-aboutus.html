      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Lamorna Wink has a history in smuggling. It was one of the original Kiddleywinks – alehouses that could be opened by anyone willing to pay the £20 required by the Beer Act of 1830.  Spirits were banned but a “wink” would get you a contraband brandy over the counter.</p>
      <p>Today The Wink also retains close links to its maritime background. Outside it appears the typical Cornish pub – mottled granite stonework, small windows dotted about, but step inside and you can’t help but notice the nautical memorabilia.</p>
      <p>Framed black and white photographs, charts & maps, brass plaques, a ships wheel above the open fire, the bell to call last orders – just some of the many pieces that all reflect both the  coastline and the pubs links with the sea.</p>
      <p>Another aspect Lamorna is renowned for is its association with the arts which goes back to the Edwardian period and continues, steadfast to this day. The stunning twists and turns, the changes of both land and seascapes about the valley along with the spangled, streaming Northern Lights, has and continues to inspire countless creatives.</p>
      <p>Probably best known of all the painters that have emerged from its “bohemian” community is Samuel John Birch – Lamorna Birch. He’s widely regarded as the father founder of The Newlyn Artists which included painters such as Laura and Harold Knight, Stanhope Forbes, Alfred Munnings, Frank Gasgoigne Heath and Stanley Gardiner – The Lamorna Artists.</p>
      <p>To this day his home and studio on the cliff-side of the Cove, remains open to the public (by appointment), held true to their original form by his grandson Adam Kerr’s wife Judith – an artist in her own right.</p>
      <p>Today Lamorna’s artistic community still thrives. With countless great painters, Gareth Edwards, Basma Ashworth, specialised potter's, toy makers, jewelry creators, stone and wood carvers – Baz and Maureen, all producing stunning pieces in their particular field of expertise. The list of talents just keeps coming.</p>
      <p>And artists are far from alone. They sit shoulder to shoulder with writers who have flocked to the valley to ponder its magic – creating dramatic prose, lyrical poems.</p>
      <p>In the 1930′s Dylan Thomas brought his mistress to spend time in Oriental Cottage. Set deep in the valley stream-side, the lovers spent their holidays in the hideaway before finally getting hitched in Penzance. Here beneath the beams of the shipwrecked “Oriental” it’s believed Dylan composed some of his great works – Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night – Death Shall Have No Dominion and of course the renowned Under Milkwood.</p>
      <p>John Le Carre – one of our finest spy novelists lives along the coast between Lamorna and St Loy, close to Tater Du Lighthouse. Looking seaward across the ever-changing waters to The Lizard, he composes the complexities and intricacies of the plots that make him a headline in this genre.</p>
      <p>And of course not forgetting – Derek and Jeanie Tangye who shed the wealth of London living in exchange for the good life in Lamorna. The couple lived in a small cottage on Oliver Land and it was here Derek produced his countless bestsellers all focusing on the beauty and simplicity about.  To this day, hundreds of fans annually flock here to commemorate the writer's death with a traditional walk from Well Lane across the moors to meet the coast at Carn Barges.</p>
      <p>Then there are the filmmakers!</p>
      <p>2012 and Dominic Cooper alongside Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens lead a cast in the film adaptation of Jonathan Smiths novel Summer in February. This is a story depicting a hidden lovers triangle at the centre of the artistic community set against the dramatic cliff sides, with the war looming ever imminent. Shot in and around the valley and coast, the cast and crew set themselves up locally to experience Lamorna.</p>
      <p>In the 1970′s the widely acclaimed cult movie Straw Dogs, starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George was filmed on the moors between Lamorna and St Buryan, portraying the darker side of a sprawling, insular, rural community.  In contrast The Shell Seekers captured all that’s idyllic about the Cornish and their landscapes, with shots of Lamorna predominating the entire movie.</p>
      <p>All these features enhance and compliment Lamorna’s stunning setting and make it even more of a must visit.</p>
